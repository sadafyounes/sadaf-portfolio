**Sadaf's Portfolio**
Welcome to my portfolio repository! This collection showcases a few of the projects I've worked on, demonstrating my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling.

**Projects**
**1. Gender Classification using Random Forest**
Description: A machine learning model that classifies gender based on various features using the Random Forest algorithm. This project aims to demonstrate classification techniques and feature importance assessment.
Tech Stack: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib
Key Concepts: Random Forest, Classification, Feature Importance, Model Evaluation
**2. Diabetes Prediction using KNN**
Description: A predictive model that uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on historical medical data. This project involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation of prediction accuracy.
Tech Stack: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib
Key Concepts: KNN, Classification, Predictive Modeling, Model Evaluation
**3. Retail Sales Analysis (EDA)**
Description: A detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) of retail sales data, where I uncovered insights about sales trends, customer behavior, and seasonality. The goal was to provide actionable insights for business decisions.
Tech Stack: Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
Key Concepts: Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Descriptive Statistics, Insights Generation
